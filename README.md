# Stanford-CS41W-PHP_Programming
Stanford Continuing Studies course CS 41W  "PHP Programming" by Eli Lev, Spring 2017 
Have you ever wondered how professional web developers create their websites? In this hands-on course, students will explore the
world of programming by learning the fundamental grammar and meaning of the PHP programming language. PHP is a computer scripting
language that has been used for many years to produce dynamic web pages. Students will come away with a fundamental understanding 
of PHP that will be applicable to other programming languages. Topics covered will include language basics (syntax, semantics, data
types), variable basics, control flow structures, functions, file handling, and ways to leverage othersâ€™ code through the use of 
libraries. By the end of the course, students will be able to write and build a program, and will be able to figure out how to 
solve a problem in a programmatic way.
