# Stanford-CS41W-PHP_Programming
Stanford Continuing Studies course CS 41W  "PHP Programming" by Eli Lev, Spring 2017 

#### Final Project Back Story: ####
You’ve been selected by Santa Claus (you’re his internet elf) to write a simple web page that will help let people know whether
they are on the naughty or nice list. You object but he points to the Stanford Continuing Studies Beginning Programming class that
you’ve been taking so you agree to do it (not that you had much of a choice to begin with – it is Santa after all). You look around
the web and you find a site that you could model - http://www.emailsanta.com/naughty_nice.asp . You decide to use this as
your model for Santa’s naughty/nice web page. However you are going to use PHP and your pages will be much cleaner.

#### Project Details: ####
You can make this project as simple or complex as you want. However, start by making the simplest application possible and then
make it more complex if you have time. Your site will consist of 2 basic pages. The input page is where you will ask the person
whether they were naughty or nice (you need to have a minimum of 4 questions with at least 2 possible answers per question).
In the second page, based on their answers – you will provide a simple certificate indicating if they are naughty or nice.

You can directly use the information from the page at http://www.emailsanta.com/naughty_nice.asp (in other words - use the same
questions or you can make up your own questions). So your first page (input page from the user) will have something like this
(no need to make it pretty – just functional):

After a person puts their name and submits the answer to the questions based on the drop downs. Based on those answers – a
result page is shown to them indicating whether they’re naughty or nice.
